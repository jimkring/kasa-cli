# kasa-cli
 A command-line application for TP-Link Kasa Smarthome products.

 Note: there's really not much to this project except for build scripts:

 - The code is simply a wrapper around the awesome [python-kasa](https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa) library.
 - The executable is built with [nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka), the amazing python compiler that's written in python.
